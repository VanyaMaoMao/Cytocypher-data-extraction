# Cytocypher Data Extraction Script

This repository contains a Python script for extracting key metrics from Ion-Optix Cytocypher “individual transients” .xlsx files. The script identifies specific columns for analysis and outputs the data in a combined text file.

## Features
- Reads data from multiple sheets in an Excel file.
- Extracts the following metrics:
  - **Peak Height**
  - **Departure Velocity**
  - **Return Velocity**
  - **Percentage of Shortening**
- Outputs the extracted data into a `.txt` file, organized by sheet name.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `pathlib`

## Usage

1. **Place the Excel File**: Save your .xlsx file in the path specified in `input_file_path`. (You can change this path in the script.)
2. **Set the Output Folder**: Specify the folder path where the output file will be saved in `output_folder_path`.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script with the following command:

## Output: 

A text file combined_data.txt will be generated in the specified output folder containing the extracted data. You can copy these data in a new Excel file using CTRL+A and CTRL+C and make further analysis in this Excel file. 

## Notes
1. Ensure that the Excel file has the specified column names: 'Peak height', 'Departure velocity', 'Return velocity', and 'Percentage of shortening'.
2. If any of these columns are missing from a sheet, the script will skip that sheet and print a warning message. Normally, you will see three messages when the code processes sheets with average data. 
3. Do not forget to define the input and output file path.
4. You can delete or change analysed parameters based on your needs (eg Time to Peak or Time to Base 90).
